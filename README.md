# Self-Driving-Car-Simulation
Implemented CV techniques with Deep Learning to interpret road scenarios, aiding perception of lane markings, obstacles, and traffic signs.  
Utilized CNNs for feature extraction and pattern recognition, essential for decision-making. 
Enhanced model accuracy and efficiency using gradient descent and fine-tuning method

## Overview

The goal of this project is to train a neural network to drive a car in a simulator. The model learns from a dataset of images captured from a car's cameras and corresponding steering angles.
